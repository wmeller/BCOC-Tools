            I generally have trouble remembering exactly how many hosts are allowed with each subnet size.
            After a few times of going back and forth with that same VLSM table and my requirements, I put together this spreadsheet to do it for me.
            Drop your user/host requirements into the given table and it will tell you what size subnet you need for that VLAN in CIDR notation. It
            will also tell you the total number of each subnet size you need to make it more compatible with the auto subnetting tool. You could also
            paste in unit NIPR/SIPR host requirements to get the WAN blocks you need to allocate to subordinates.

            The second addition to this website! Give it your starting block of IP's and the size of your block, then tell it what subnets you need.
             It will generate a table of IP addresses for you with size, network and broadcast addresses, and your remaining IP addresses in reserve.

            This spreadsheet lets you load in your SLD Matrix and it will generate the tasks for you for both MCR links and network links.
           I wrote this tool for the MCR and networking TDG's, so it may require some updates for future assignments. It should do at least 90% of the work though.
           At this point, network link speeds are determined by looking at the physical link for that network. The matrix doesn't know anything about multiple links between the same site.

            The Equipment Matrix to Tasking Statements tool will generate tasking statements from your equipment allocation matrix (duh).
            There are two sheets. Use the first as a pre-built MCR equipment table, and just fill out numbers. If you want to generate tasks for any old equipment,
            flip to the second tab and fill out the unit names, equipment type and quantities. You can probably just paste the entire table from the template in,
            as long as you didn't mess with the template at all.

            <p></p>
            The Sine Wave superposition demo visualizes the fundamental geometry of radio waves - sin waves, and how they can be added together. This is the mathematical
            principle used for adding information to radio waves, detangling multiple RF signals impinging on a single antenna, and handing data off from one physical device
            to another. Play around with the characteristics of the two pre-defined waves to see how they superimpose on each other to create a new third wave.
            (NOTE: If the two signals you choose are 180 deg out of sync, mathematically, you should see a resulting signal of amplitude 0. You won't. Because of how Excel
            calculates sine values, you will see a small residual value usually of the order of 1E-14, which are basically rounding error.)
